All_Emails.xlsx is the key data from each of the emails in the disclosure, including post-collapse investigative emails.

Involved_Parties_Emails.xlsx is the spreadsheet for emails from the involved parties only (extracted to ./Data/). This includes some emails that aren't in the disclosure (Site Emails).

This format should make reviewing the emails much faster than opening them individually in Outlook.

The emails haven't been categorized at all, many emails are not iSpan related.

The Excel sheet has relative hyperlinks to the original files. If the relative locations of these files changes the links will break.

Due to limitations in Excel, paths longer than 241 characters are printed as strings rather than hyperlinks.
