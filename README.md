Data.xlsx is the key data from each of the emails in the disclosure extracted into an excel sheet.

This format should make reviewing the emails much faster than opening them individually in Outlook.

These haven't been categorized at all, several emails are not iSpan related.

The Excel sheet has relative hyperlinks to the original files. If the relative locations of these files changes the links will break.
